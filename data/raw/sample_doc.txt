Sample Document for RAG Testing

This is a sample document that demonstrates how the RAG system works.
The system will chunk this document, create embeddings, and store them
in a FAISS index for efficient retrieval.

Key Concepts:
- Vector embeddings represent text semantically
- FAISS enables fast similarity search
- RAG combines retrieval with generation
- Citations help trace information back to sources
